# The Historical Data Digital Toolkit (HDDT) #

The HDDT constitutes a new approach to nineteenth century history with the use of data science techniques deployed to the study of ordered historical data – in and of itself.
The HDDT Enables historians to create a desktop data pipeline by integrating multiple archival datasets into one SQLite HDDT database. The resulting HDDT combined data can then be cleaned, viewed, analysed, and visualised by using compatible open-source software packages (Jupyter Notebooks and Gephi). The HDDT is designed to enable historical ordered data to be surveyed, much as an archaeologist might use a variety of technologies to survey a territorial site of historical interest. The HDDT is not a tool for finding individual or even several items in an archive.

Exponential population growth in the nineteenth century presents volume of archived data challenges. Fortunately, a prolonged cultural, disciplined, and extensive interest in collecting, cataloguing, and preserving historical artefacts and manuscripts, was pursued by collectors at the time, and archivists later. This has resulted in the accessibility of a huge quantity of ordered and organised historical data, especially of manuscripts and print. This offers to the historian an opportunity to study communities and whole societies ‘en masse’. 

The historical archives of the nineteenth century are often very large (and are immense when viewed collectively), they are too big to be surveyed by the naked eye or even by using 'office' based technologies. Nonetheless they offer rich sources of ordered data sets (organised, catalogued and frequently cross-referenced to each other). Furthermore, archived nineteenth century manuscripts frequently include ‘within themselves’ ordered data items including surveys, lists and indexes. These are a rich source of historical data. Data science is now capable of handling ordered historical data on large scales, it is time to devise a way for digital historical data to be studied in and of itself, free of narratology, by using technologies capable of embracing mass data. 

In the recent past, historical research in the archive has been limited to only one tool of assistance, the ‘catalogue search engine’. Search engines are designed to 'narrow down' from the whole of the collection to land on a discrete set of manuscripts or artefacts. The object has been to produce a handful of manageable items capable of study by a few visits (usually) by one historian to one or a few archives. 

This approach is still immensely valuable but when surveying the modern period with its large population and extended democratisation it is insufficient, because it leaves too much unaccounted for, leaves too many ignored, and uses a torch where a lighthouse is needed. The HDDT addresses this need and provides a satisfactory way of studying mass data across multiple archives. With the HDDT there is no need to limit history to only the rich, the powerful, the clever or the famous. The HDDT is designed to include everyone on every list, in every catalogue.

The 3000 people active in the Centres for the Emergence of the Discipline of Anthropology in Britain (The CEDA) 1830 – 1870, and the 600 Quakers amongst them are the test case explored in this project. The larger and smaller communities are analysed year by year both statically and dynamically, focussing on the bigraph relationships of the larger community to the locations, occupations, societies and clubs they belonged to, and amongst the Quaker community – their family relationships.
